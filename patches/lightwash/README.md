LIGHTWASH
=========

Jesse Mejia created the LIGHTWASH installation at Composition gallery in November 2014.

https://github.com/jmej/composition/

The installation consisted of 4 speakers and 6 bright multicolor, ceiling-mounted LEDs.
Sound is generated by Pd and consists of:

* a tone source
* 5 relative tone sources
* LP an HP filters for the tone sources
* a strange noise source
* a LFO/bass frequency generator
* panning control for the above
* VCA control for the above

The installation is controlled by Pd and operates in a generative mode, but can also 
be controlled over the local network via OSC messages.
6 collaborators were invited to take control of the installation for approximately 
10 minute performances.

The Pd materials here are what I used during LIGHT WASH.
